          DESCRIPTION="🎥 **remote_desktop** is a high-performance **remote desktop streaming** application built in **Rust**, inspired by **TeamViewer**. It allows a **server** to capture a client's screen and stream it to other connected clients in real-time."

          echo "- ✅ **Multi-Client Support**: A single **server** can stream to multiple **clients** simultaneously." >> README.md
          echo "- ✅ **Real-Time Video Capture**: Uses `scrap` crate to capture screen efficiently." >> README.md
          echo "- ✅ **Async Data Streaming**: Built on top of **Tokio** for high-speed async communication." >> README.md
          echo "- ✅ **Efficient Networking**: Uses **TCP/UDP sockets** for seamless transmission." >> README.md

          echo "1. **Server** listens for incoming connections from clients." >> README.md
          echo "2. **Client** captures its screen using the `scrap` crate." >> README.md
          echo "3. **Captured frames** are encoded and streamed to the server using **Tokio**." >> README.md
          echo "4. **Server** receives the video feed and broadcasts it to all connected clients in real-time." >> README.md
          echo "5. **Clients** can view the live feed from the server." >> README.md
